/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global object binding sets `this` to object or window value
* 2. implicit binding lets create functions off of objects easily with this. The this is always before the dot e.g myObj.myFunc() myObj is `this`
* 3. New binding helps create new objects using this and constructor functions. When using constructor functions it `this` refers to the specific instance of the object created by the constructor function. 
* 4. when the call or apply method is call this is the same as the function 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
